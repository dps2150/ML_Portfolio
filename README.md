# LSTM Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization
Portfolio optimization is a crucial task in investment management, where asset
managers attempt to maximize the returns while simultaneously minimizing the
risk of their investments. In this paper, we introduce different adaptations of Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict the expected returns and volatility
preceding portfolio optimization with Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO). We
compare the performance of the different LSTM-MVO models using historical data
on selected assets and evaluate their effectiveness on portfolio optimization. Our
results show that LSTM models can predict the expected returns and volatility
better than historical performance alone, which suggests ML models have a
potential ancillary place in portfolio management.
